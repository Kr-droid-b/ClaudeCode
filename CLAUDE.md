- How to run tests
- How to lint and format code

## Guidelines for AI Assistants

1. **Read before editing** — Always read files before proposing changes.
2. **Minimal changes** — Only make changes that are directly requested. Avoid over-engineering.
3. **Keep this file updated** — When adding tooling, dependencies, or new directories, update CLAUDE.md to reflect the current state.
4. **No secrets** — Never commit `.env` files, credentials, API keys, or other sensitive data.
5. **Commit messages** — Use imperative mood, keep the subject line under 72 characters.
